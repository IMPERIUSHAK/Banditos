## Bandit level 25 ---> level 26

## Level Goal 
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

    NOTE: if you’re a Windows user and typically use Powershell to ssh into bandit: Powershell is known to cause issues with the intended solution to this level. You should use command prompt instead.
## Solution
```
First we should find out what shell is in level 26
bandit25@melinda:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext

#so that means that shell in level 26 runs /sometext every time we r login, let find it out
bandit25@melinda:~$ cat /usr/bin/showtext 
#!/bin/sh
more ~/text.txt    #!!!NOTICE that script runs more comand
exit 0
```
# !!!NOTICE that script runs `more` comand

`lets try to login with installed sshkey`

```
bandit25@melinda:~$ ls
bandit26.sshkey

$ scp -P 2220 bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:bandit26.sshkey 
```
So as you can see after login we instantly disconnected, In this case we should use `more` comand features make your terminal window so you see just 1-2 line of code
then try again `ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
Now you can clearly see that more comand activates
!Additional knowledge ```you can use bash comands in vim```
type 'v' then vi -> to open vim
after vim opens type `:set shell=/bin/bash` this comand will set default shell for level 26 `/bin/bash/sometext` to `/bin/bash`
then `:shell` to open shell
now you have access to level 26 to passwd type `cat /etc/bandit\_pass/bandit26`
