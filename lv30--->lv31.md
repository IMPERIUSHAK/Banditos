## Bandit Level 30 ---> Level 31

## Level Goal
There is a git repository at ssh://bandit30-git@localhost/home/bandit30-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit30-git is the same as for the user bandit30.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.
Commands you may need to solve this level

git tag, git show

# Theory 
Git tagging is a way to mark specific points in the history of the repository. 
One example would be to mark release points of the software. The command to see the tags is git tag. 
To create a tag the command is git tag -a <tag_name> -m <"tag description/message">. 
To see more details, like the tag message and commit, you can use the following command: git show <tag_name>.

## Solution 
```
bandit30@bandit:~$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.10J2KXLhVV
bandit30@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.10J2KXLhVV
bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.10J2KXLhVV$ 
bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.10J2KXLhVV$ git clone ssh://bandit30-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit30-git/repo
